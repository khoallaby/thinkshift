                <h3>The idea of a static “plan” that you use to climb the “ladder” and hope to
arrive to success is not as applicable today as it was before. We all must now
create dynamic plans as individuals and be prepared to pivot given that we will
likely have multiple careers over our lifetime. We should now see our lives as
having multiple gateways to mobility and fulfillment. This is now the way
people must reimagine success in the 21st century.</h3>
