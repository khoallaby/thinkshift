                <h3>Change won’t stop. Can you keep up?</h3>
                <p>Frenzied transformations in work and life have created a range of new opportunities, but have also left many people disoriented and struggling to regain power over their lives.</p>
                <p>In the past, people could be reasonably confident of achieving success through a path of getting a degree, getting hired, and climbing that employer’s ladder. But the rapid pace of change in work and life means that we can’t expect such sure, linear paths to success.</p>

                <h3>To succeed amid change, you need a different kind of preparation.</h3>
                <p>Today, your chances for economic security and advancement depend on not being reliant on a single path, but being able to reposition yourself and make many new plays, or pivots, across your lifetime.</p>
